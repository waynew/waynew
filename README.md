NAME
       Wayne Werner

PRONOUNS
       He/Him/They

DESCRIPTION
       All human beings have worth, simply by virtue of being human beings. - Wayne

       A human being intensely protective of his time, so it can be given
       generously. A lover of all things command-line.

OPTIONS
   email
       Send me an email. This is the most surefire (though potentially high
       latency) way to contact me. I'm a fan of VSRE emails.

   RSS
       Both my gopher and web page offer an RSS (Well, Atom really) feed.

   gopher
       Gopher is an insanely simple protocol, probably my favorite. Pull option.

   website
       HTTP(s) protocol, also a pull option.

DIAGNOSTICS
   Q: I didn't receive a response, what should I do?
       It's possible that I'm busy helping other people, or perhaps I'm taking
       a vacation. If it's not an emergency, wait a while. Otherwise, try
       pinging me again.

   Q: I seem to have offended you, what can I do?
       I'm fairly easy going, and also quick to forgive. The number one way to
       offend me is to do or say something to disagree with my fundamental
       belief that all human beings have worth.

   Q: Did you really write an man about-me page?
       You're reading it, aren't you?

BUGS
       Prefers boring technology, can be committed to the point of
       stubbornness. Likes puns.
